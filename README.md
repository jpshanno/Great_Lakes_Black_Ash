Species level maps for both the United States and Canada are available as 250 m<sup>2</sup> resolution rasters, estimated using nearest neighbor analysis. The US data is accessible through the US Forest Service [Wilson, et al (2013)](https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2013-0013), and the Canadian data is provided by National Forest Inventory, [Beaudoin, et al (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-0401). The Canadian data is provided in aboveground biomass (t ha<sup>-1</sup>), and the US data is provided in basal area (ft<sup>2</sup> ac<sup>-1</sup>). An _F. nigra_ specific aboveground biomass equation was created by combining the equations from Parker and Schneider (1975) and Reiners (1972), taken from [GTR-NE-319](https://www.fs.fed.us/ne/global/pubs/books/dia_biomass/index.shtml). Models to estimate tree level sapwood area from diameter, stand level sapwood area from basal area, and stand level basal area from aboveground biomass, were generated using 2012 inventory data, and sapwood area measurements from the MTU black ash study. Sap flux rates used to calculate water use were taken from modeled data where Sap Flux (ft<sup>3</sup>ft<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>) = Species * WL (cm) * sqrt{D_z (kPa)} + (1|tree/probe). WL is the water level at the root collar of the tree and D~z~ is the day-length normalized vapor pressure deficit.
